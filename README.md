# THECAPSTONE

This is the repository for JMU's CIS capstone project. We had 6 weeks to develop a working system for a client.
Our team developed a system that earned us top 5 in the system competition out of 15 teams. The technology stack that we used included the following technologies: 
HTML5, CSS4, JavaScript, C#, ASP.Net, SQL SERVER, Bootstrap, Amazon Web services RDS, Amazon Web services Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon Web Services EC2, Git and Github.
