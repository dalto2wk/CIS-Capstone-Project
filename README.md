# THECAPSTONE

This is our repository for JMU's CIS capstone project. We had 6 weeks to develop a working system for a client.
Our team developed a system that earned us top 5 in the system competition out of 15 teams. The technology stack that we used included the following technologies: 
HTML5, CSS4, JavaScript, C#, ASP.Net, SQL SERVER, Bootstrap, Amazon Web services RDS, Amazon Web services Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon Web Services EC2, Git and Github. 

Our team had to create a system that would help bridge the gap between High school students and local employers. This would help High school students get connected with local employers and provide employers opportunities to work with or hire these students. Our system had the business employer user focus. We created a system where a busniess employer could login and see data and forms related to connecting with local schools, students, and other businesses.
